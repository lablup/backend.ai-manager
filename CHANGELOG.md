20.03.0 (2020-07-28)
--------------------

### Features
* Add purge mutations for users, groups, and domains. ([#302](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-manager/issues/302))

### Fixes
* Raise explicit exception when no keypair is found during login. ([#297](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-manager/issues/297))
* Adds context for the call to from_row in simple_db_mutate_returning_item. ([#300](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-manager/issues/300))
* The session creation API now returns the session UUID as part of its response, in addition to the meaningless client-provided session alias (name) ([#303](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-manager/issues/303))

20.03.0rc1 (2020-07-23)
-----------------------

### Breaking Changes
* Replace user's boolean-based `is_active` field to a enum-based `status` field to represent multiple user statuses with lifecycle state transitions, changing the signup API and related DB columns.
* Change the argument type of `user_id` in `user_from_uuid` GraphQL query to the generic `ID` ([#299](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-manager/issues/299))

### Fixes
* Fix misuse of a legacy API in the `etcd move-subtree` manager command, which has unintentionally flattened nested dicts when inserting the data to the new location ([#295](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-manager/issues/295))
* Mask sensitive keys when logging API parameters for debugging ([#296](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-manager/issues/296))
* A set of API behavior fixes ([#299](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-manager/issues/299))
  - Fix missing conversion of `user_id` argument to UUID type when resolving the `user_from_uuid` GraphQL query
  - Exclude cancelled sessions from the active session count in the manager status API
  - Fix missing update for user's `status_info` as "admin-requested" when marked as deleted by administrators

### Miscellaneous
* Refactor session usage api. ([#298](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-manager/issues/298))


20.03.0b2 (2020-07-02)
----------------------

### Breaking Changes
* Apply the plugin API v2 -- all stats/error/webapp/hook plugins must be updated along with the manager ([#291](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-manager/issues/291))

### Features
* Group-shared vfolders named ".local" (while other dot-prefixed names are not allowed for group vfolders) now have per-user subdirectories (using user UUIDs) for per-user persistent package installation reusable across different sessions ([#224](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-manager/issues/224))
* Download a directory from vfolder as an archive. ([#278](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-manager/issues/278))
* Execute POST_SIGNUP hook after sign up. ([#286](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-manager/issues/286))
* Pass Accept-Language header to post-signup hook. ([#287](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-manager/issues/287))
* Add a feature to kick off user who is shared virtual folder. ([#288](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-manager/issues/288))
* Add a global announcement get/set API which stores an arbitrary string in the "manager/announcement" etcd key. ([#289](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-manager/issues/289))
* Add option to reserve batch session. ([#290](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-manager/issues/290))
* Add modified_at column to users and keypairs table. ([#293](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-manager/issues/293))
* Add super-admin APIs to temporarily exclude specific agents from scheduling and include later by changing the `schedulable` column of the `agents` table. ([#294](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-manager/issues/294))

### Fixes
* Destroying sessions now returns periodically collected statistics instead of last-moment statistics ([#279](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-manager/issues/279))
* Apply batching to statistics synchroniztion to minimize time used inside DB transactions by batching and splitting transaction blocks ([#280](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-manager/issues/280))
* Add fallback if any keys under last_stat have None value during statistics calculation. ([#282](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-manager/issues/282))
* Fix the responses for `compute_session` GQL query when there are no or multiple matching sessions ([#283](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-manager/issues/283))
* ([#284](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-manager/issues/284))
  - Fix too many scheduler invocation with stale periodic scheduling ticks after manager restarts/maintenance
  - Split DB transactions for schedulers as fine-grained, small-sized transactions to cope with a large number of pending sessions
* Ensure resolving of kernel IDs before doing complex operations in `AgentRegistry` to prevent potential races against the unique constraints about kernel statuses and user-defined session names under heavy loads ([#292](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-manager/issues/292))


20.03.0b1 (2020-05-12)
----------------------

### Breaking Changes
* Now it runs on Python 3.8 or higher only.
* Rename all APIs to use "session" instead of "kernel" ([#216](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-manager/issues/216))
* API v5 support
  - All session-related GraphQL schema is rewritten to reflect multi-container sessions and kernel -> session parameter and API renamings. ([#263](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-manager/issues/263))

### Features
* Un-numbered features
  - Now all CLI commands are accessible via ``backend.ai mgr``. [(lablup/backend.ai#101)](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai/issues/101)
  - Add more convenient manager CLI commands: `etcd quote`, `etcd unquote`, `etcd move-subtree`
  - Add `--short` and `--installed` options to the `etcd list-images` command.
  - Add a minimum-occupied slot first scheduler.
* Now our manager-to-agent RPC uses [Callosum](https://github.com/lablup/callosum) instead of aiozmq, supporting Python 3.8 natively. ([#209](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-manager/issues/209))
* Add vfolder large-file upload APIs using the tus.io protocol. ([#210](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-manager/issues/210))
* User-customizable per-scaling-group session queue scheduler plugins and three intrinsic plugins: FIFO, LIFO, and the DRF (dominant resource fairness) scheduler. ([#212](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-manager/issues/212))
* User-manageable session templates written in YAML to reuse session creation parameters. ([#213](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-manager/issues/213))
* ResourceSlots are now more permissive so that agents with different sets of accelerator plugins can now coexist in a single cluster. ([#214](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-manager/issues/214))
* Add pre-open service ports to allow user-written applications listening on a container port and make such ports accessible via the stream proxy API. ([#221](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-manager/issues/221))
* Auto-fill the minimum resource slots for intrinsic slots only to allow execution of sessions with different set of accelerators simultaneously. ([#234](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-manager/issues/234))
* Error logging API and an intrinsic plugin to store all unhandled exceptions in agents and managers.
  (Agent exceptions are passed via the event bus) ([#235](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-manager/issues/235))
* Reduce possibility of aioredlock locking errors. ([#236](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-manager/issues/236))
* Favor CPU agents for session creation requests without accelerators ([#241](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-manager/issues/241))
* Add user-config APIs to update/get keypair bootstrap script ([#253](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-manager/issues/253))
* Accept session UUIDs and their prefixes in addition to client-specified IDs (names) ([#258](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-manager/issues/258))
* API v5 support ([#263](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-manager/issues/263))

* Fix errors on fetching server logs and vfolder list ([#264](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-manager/issues/264))
* Remove unwanted empty key while setting etcd config with nested dict. ([#275](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-manager/issues/275))

### Miscellaneous
* Internally refactored the main function for easier writing of future unit tests by composing different resource cleanup contexts in a modular way, using aiohttp's cleanup contexts.
* Now all changelogs are managed using [towncrier](https://github.com/twisted/towncrier) and migrated to Markdown syntax. ([#262](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-manager/issues/262))
* Refactor `batch_result()` and `batch_multiresult()` used for optimizing SQL-based GraphQL queries ([#263](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-manager/issues/263))
