  backward compatibility.

19.09.4 (2019-10-15)

  You MUST update the agent to 19.09.1 as well!

  HA setup
* FIX: Wrap more Redis operations in GQL resolvers with retries

19.09.0rc4 (2019-10-04)
-----------------------

This is the last preview, feature-freeze release for v19.09 series.
Stability updates will follow in the v19.09.0 and possibly a few more v19.09.x releases.

* NEW: Image import ([#171](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-manager/issues/171)) - currently this is limited to import Python-based kernels only.
  This is implemented on top of batch tasks, with some specialization to prevent security issues
  due to direct access to agent host's Docker daemon.  Importing as service-port only image support will
  be added in future releases.
* NEW: Batch tasks ([#199](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-manager/issues/199)) - the kernel creation API now has an extra "type" parameter (default:
  "interactive") which can be set "batch" with another new parameter "startupCommand".  The batch-type
  sessions (batch tasks) run the startup command immdediately after starting and automatically terminates
  after finishing it, with a success/failure result recorded in the database retrievable as the "result"
  column.

  The execution logs are stored in the ".logs" user vfolder if present, which will be mounted all
  user-owned compute sessions automatically.  This log can be retrieved at any time using the new
  `kernel/_/logs` API (task-logs API).
* IMPROVE: Allow admins to create sessions on behalf of other users.
* SECURITY-FIX: Privilege escalation because domain-admins could run sessions on behalf of super-admins
  in the same domain.
* Various bug fixes and improvements.

19.09.0rc3 (2019-09-25)
-----------------------

* FIX: status field parsing in legacy GraphQL queries (non-paginated compute_sessions)
* FIX: scaling group's remaining resource must be capped by the user's keypair resource limits.
* FIX: Sign-up plugin hook check

19.09.0rc2 (2019-09-24)
-----------------------

* FIX: Corruption of kernels.concurrency_used in specific scheduling conditions
* IMPROVE: Terminating PENDING sessions and permanent scheduling failures makes the sessions
  to be CANCELLED.
* NEW: Support specifying multiple status values to compute_sessions and compute_session_list
  GraphQL queries so that clients can display sessions of multiple statuses in a single view.
  - Since GraphQL does not allow union of scalar types, use comma-separated string in the
    status field of those queries. This keeps the backward compatibility.
  - Now the default ordering is "greatest(created_at, terminated_at, status_changed)" in the
    descending order.  "alembic upgrade" is required to create appropriate database indexes.
* FIX: Missing generation of "kernel_cancelled" and "kernel_terminating" events
* FIX: Server hang-up when shutting down with clients to wait for PENDING sessions to start up
* FIX: Missing "reason" field when users terminate sessions

19.09.0rc1 (2019-09-23)
-----------------------

* NEW: Support for high availability (#125, #192) with zero reconfiguration when fail-over
  of the manager.
  - The manager may have multiple nodes now. Adding/removing nodes just work, as long as
    the client configurations for "multi-endpoints" get updated accordingly.
  - There is no central master of the manager fleet. All manager instances are equivalent.
  - Intermittent disruptions over Redis connections (e.g., due to fail-over of Redis master)
    no longer make both manager/agent to hang up or go into undefined states.
* NEW: Job queueing (#192, #180, #189), so that excessive job execution no longer raises
  errors but those requests are "queued".
  The current scheduling is FIFO but more scheduling options will be added in the future.
  - Now the kernels have PENDING and CANCELLED status.  Any permanent errors before RUNNING status
    makes the kernel to transition into the CANCELLED status.
  - Each status change is recorded with explicit timestamp and a human-readable "status_info" which
    can be retrieved by clints via GQL.
* NEW: event monitoring API for session lifecycles so that now clients can get to know
  whether the session is pulling a new docker image or just hanging up (#84, #110)
* Various bug fixes related to role/active checks and updates in user maangement (#193, #194 and many
  one-off commits)

19.09.0b14 (2019-09-17)
-----------------------

* NEW: A superadmin API to list all vfolder hosts and docker registires.
* UPDATE: resource/check-presets API is updated to return per-scaling-group remainings and
  group/domain resource limits. ([#184](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-manager/issues/184))
* UPDATE: Compute session GQL queries now include the `resource_opts` field.
* Minor bug fixes.

19.09.0b13 (2019-09-09)
-----------------------

  in the kernelc reation config API (lablup/backend.ai#52)
* UPDATE: Enhance vfolder download APIs to support ranged HTTP requests for partial downloads and
  fix the browser-side fetch() API content decoding error due to the default behavior of
  aiohttp.web.FileResponse implementation.
* Alembic migrations are now distributed as a part of the source and wheel package.
  Set `script_location = ai.backend.manager.models:alembic` in your alembic.ini configuration file.

* NEW: bugx fixes and mount option support for vfolder mount API ([#183](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-manager/issues/183))

19.09.0b11 (2019-08-30)
-----------------------

* NEW: superadmin APIs for mount/unmount vfolder hosts ([#183](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-manager/issues/183))
* FIX: resource usage API validation error when it is used with URL query strings

19.09.0b10 (2019-08-27)
-----------------------

* FIX: plain users could see other users' sessions due to a missing
  access-key filtering condition in the GQL loader implementation
  for `compute_sessions` query.
* FIX: an unexpected error at creating a new user when there is no default group.
  Changed to add the user to the default group only when it exists.
* Add `mem_allocated` field to group usage statistics
* Various bug fixes for config/get and config/set APIs

19.09.0b8 (2019-08-19)
----------------------

* FIX: Mitigate race condition when checking keypair/group/domain resource limits ([#180](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-manager/issues/180))
  - KNOWN ISSUE: The current fix only covers a single-process deployment of the manager.
* NEW: Introduce "is_installed" filtering condition to the "images" GraphQL query.
* NEW: Watcher APIs to control agents remotely ([#179](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-manager/issues/179))
* Pin the pyzmq version 18.1.0 (lablup/backend.ai#47)

19.09.0b6 (2019-08-14)
----------------------

* NEW: Add option to change underlying event loop implementation.
* Updated signup/login hook support.
* CHANGE: In the response of kernel creation API, service port information only expose
  the name and protocol pairs, since port numbers are useless in the client-side.

19.09.0b5 (2019-08-05)
----------------------

* NEW: Scaling groups to partition agents into differently scheduled groups (#73, #167)
* NEW: Image lists are now filtered by docker registries allowed for each domain. ([#170](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-manager/issues/170))
* NEW: "/auth/role" API to get the current user's role/privilege information
* CHANGE: GraphQL queries are now unified for all levels of users!
  - The allow/deny decision is made per each query and mutation.
* FIX: `refresh_session()` was not called to keep service port connections.
