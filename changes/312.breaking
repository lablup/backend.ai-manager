Configuration/DB changes are required for storage proxies
- To use vfolders, now the storage proxy must be installed and configured.
- The "volumes" key in the etcd must include storage proxy configurations,
  as demonstrated in the `config/sample.volume.json` file.
- All vfolder hosts are now in the format of "{proxy-name}:{volume-name}"
  where proxy-name is the key in the etcd and volume-name values are retrieved from
  the storage proxies at runtime.
- All `allowed_vfolder_hosts` configurations in the database must be updated to
  the above new vfolder host format.
- Clients should use the same vfolder host format when making API requests.
