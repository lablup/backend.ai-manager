Changes
=======

19.03.0rc2 (2018-03-25)
-----------------------

- NEW: Add an explicit "owner_access_key" query parameter to all session-related APIs
  (under /kernel/ prefix) so that admininstrators can perform API requests such as
  termination on sessions owned by other users.

- NEW: Add a new API for renaming vfolders (#82)

- CHANGE: Now idle timeouts are configured by keypair resource policies. (#92)

- CHANGE: Rename "--redis-auth" option to "--redis-password" and its
  environment variable equivalent as well.

- Now non-admin users are able to query their own keypairs and resource policies via
  the GraphQL API.

- Improve stability with many concurrent clients and lossy connections by shielding
  DB-access coroutines to prevent DB connection pool corruption. (#140)

- Increase the default rate-limit for keypairs from 1,000 to 30,000 for better GUI
  integration.

- Reduce chances for timeout errors when there are bursty session creation requests.

- Other bug fixes and improvements.

19.03.0rc1 (2018-02-25)
-----------------------

- NEW: It now supports authentication with etcd and Redis for better security.

  - NOTE: etcd authentication is unusable yet in productions due to a missing
    implementation of auto-refreshing auth tokens in the upstream etcd3 binding
    library.

- Implement GQL mutations for KeyPairResourcePolicy.

- Fix vfolder listing queries in all places to consider invited vfolders and owned
  vfolders correctly.

- Add missing "compute_session_list" GQL field to the user-mode GQL schema.

- Minor bug fixes and improvements.

19.03.0b9 (2018-02-15)
----------------------

- NEW: Add pagination support to the GraphQL API (#132)

- CHANGE: Unspecified (or zero'ed) per-image resource limits are now treated as
  *unlimited*.

- Implement RW/RO permissions when mounting shared vfolders (#82)

- Fix various bugs including CLI commands for image aliases, the session restart
  API, skipping SSL certificate verification in CLI commands, fixture population with
  enum values and already-inserted rows, and session termination hang-up in specific
  environments where locally bound sockets are not accessible via the node's
  network-local IP address.

19.03.0b8 (2018-02-08)
----------------------

- NEW: resource policy for keypairs (#134)

  - Now admins can limit the maximum number of concurrent session, virtual folders,
    and the total resource slots used by each access key.

  - IMPORTANT: DB migration is required (if you upgrade from prior beta versions).

    Before migrating, you *MUST BACKUP* the existing keypairs table if you want to
    preserve the "concurrency_limit" column, as it will be reset to 30 using a
    "default" keypair resource policy.  Also, the default policy allows unlimited
    resource slots to preserve the previous behavior while it limits the number of
    vfolders to 10 per access key and enables only the "local" vfolder host.  You
    need to adjust those settings using the dbshell (SQL)!

  - NOTE: Fancy GraphQL mutation APIs for the resource policies (and their CLI/GUI
    counterparts) will come in the next version.

  - NOTE: Currently the vfolder size limit is not enforced since it is not
    implemented yet.

- Support big integers (up to 53 bits or 8192 TiB) when serializing various
  statistics fields in the GraphQL API. (#133)

- Add "--skip-sslcert-validation" CLI option and "BACKEND_SKIP_SSLCERT_VALIDATION"
  environment variable for setups using privately-signed SSL certificates

19.03.0b7 (2018-02-03)
----------------------

- Fix various issues related to resource slot type *changes*.

  - Ignore unknown slots except when the user explicitly requests one.

  - Always reset resource slot types when processing heartbeats.

    IMPORTANT: You must install the same set of accelerator plugins across all your
    agent nodes so that they report the same set of resource slot types even when
    some agents does not have support for specific accelerator plugins.  Also,
    plugins are required to return "disabled" plugin instance which specified the
    resource slot types but returns no available devices.

- Add a small API to get currently known resource slots from clients:
  "<ENDPOINT>/etcd/resource-slots"

- Now "occupied_slots" field and "available_slots" field in the Admin GraphQL APIs
  returns a consistent set of keys from the known resource slot types.

19.03.0b6 (2018-01-31)
----------------------

- Various small-but-required bug fixes

  - When signing API requests, it now uses ``raw_path`` instead of ``rel_url``
    to preserve the URL-encoded query string intact.

  - Large kernel iamges scanned from registries caused a graphene error due to
    out-of-range 32-bit signed integers in the "size_bytes" field.  Adopted a custom
    BigInt scalar to coerce big integers to Javascript floats since modern JS engines
    mostly support up to 52-bit floating point numbers.

    *NOTE:* The next ECMAScript standard will support explicit big numbers with the
    "n" suffix, which is experimentally implemented in the V8 engine last year.
    (https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2018/05/bigint)

  - An aiohttp API compatibility issue in the vfolder download handler.

  - Fix the missing "installed" field value in GraphQL's "images" query.

  - Fix a missing check for "is_active" status of keypairs during API request
    authentication.

19.03.0b5 (2018-01-31)
----------------------

- Fix various migration issues related to JSON fields and SQL.

19.03.0b4 (2018-01-30)
----------------------

- Add "installed" field to GraphQL image/images query results so that
  the client could know whether if an image has any agent that locally has it.

- Remove aiojobs.atomic decorators from gateway.kernel API handlers to prevent
  blocking due to long agent-side operations such as image pulling.

- Fix a regression in the query/batch mode code execution due to old codes
  in the websocket handlers.

19.03.0b3 (2018-01-30)
----------------------

- Add missing support for legacy GraphQL "image" / "images" queries.

- Add "--min" switch to "set-image-resource-limit" manager CLI command.

- Fix missing metrics in some cases.

- Fix a logical error preventing session creation when min/max are same.

19.03.0b2 (2018-01-30)
----------------------

- Support legacy GraphQL clients by interpolating new JSON-based resource fields.

- Fix interpretation of private docker image references without explicit repository
  subpaths. Previously it was assume to be under "lablup/" always.

19.03.0b1 (2018-01-30)
----------------------

- BIG: Support for dynamic resource slots and full private Docker registries. (#127)
  Now all resource-related fields in APIs/DB are JSON.

- Support running multiple managers on the same host by randomizing internal IPC
  socket addresses.  This also improves the security a little.

- Support bodyless (query params intead) GET requests for vfolder/kernel file
  download APIs.

19.03.0a2 (2018-01-21)
----------------------

- Bump API version from v4.20181215 to v4.20190115 to allow clients to distinguish
  streaming execution API support.

- Fix the backend.ai-common dependency version follow the 19.03 series.

19.03.0a1 (2018-01-18)
----------------------

- Add support for NVIDIA GPU Cloud images.

- Internally changed a resource slot name from "gpu" to "cuda".
  Still the API and database uses the old name for backward-compatibility.

18.12.0 (2018-01-06)
--------------------

- Version numbers now follow year.month releases like Docker.
  We plan to release stable versions on every 3 months (e.g., 18.12, 19.03, ...).

- NEW: Support TPU (Tensor Processing Units) in Google Clouds.

- Clean up log messages for devops & IT admins.

- Add PyTorch v1.0 image metadata.

  kernel images.

- CHANGE: Change fixtures from a Python module to static JSON files.
  Now the example keypair fixture reside in the sample-configs directory.

  - ``python -m ai.backend.manager.cli fixture populate`` is changed to accept
    a path to the fixture JSON file.

  - ``python -m ai.backend.manager.cli fixture list`` is now deprecated.

- CHANGE: The process monitoring tools will now show prettified process names for
  Backend.AI's daemon processes which exhibit the role and key configurations (e.g.,
  namespace) at a glance.

- Improve support for using custom/private Docker registries.

18.12.0a1 (2018-12-14)
----------------------

- NEW: App service ports!  You can start a compute session and directly connect to a
  service running inside it, such as Jupyter Notebook! (#121)

- Extended CORS support for web browser clients.

- Monitoring tools are separated as plugins.

1.4.7 (2018-11-24)
------------------

- Technical release to fix an internal merge error.

------------------

- Fix various bugs.

  - Fix kernel restart regression bug.
  - Fix code execution with API v4 requests.
  - Fix auth test URLs.
  - Fix Server response headers in subapps.

1.4.5 (2018-11-22)
------------------

- backport: Accept API v4 requests (lablup/backend.ai#30)
  In API v4, the authentication signature always uses an emtpy string
  as the request body element to allow easier implementation of streaming
  and proxies.

- Fix handling of empty/unspecified execute API options (#116)

- Fix storing of fractional resources reported by agents

- Update image metadata/aliases for TensorFlow 1.12 and PyTorch

1.4.4 (2018-11-09)
------------------

- Update the default image metadata/aliases to include latest deep learning kernels.

1.4.3 (2018-11-06)
------------------

- Fix creation of GPU sessions with GPU resource limits unspecified in the
  client-side.  The problem was due to a combination of misconfiguration
  (image-metadata.yml) and mishandling of "None" values with valid dictionary keys.

- Update coding style rules and the flake8 package.

1.4.2 (2018-11-01)
------------------

- Fix a critical regression bug of tracking available memory (RAM) of agents due to
  changes to relative resource shares from absolute resource amounts.

- Backport a temporary patch to limit the maximum number of kernel execution records
  returned by the admin GraphQL API (until we have a proper pagination support).

- Update the list of our public kernel images as we add support for latest TensorFlow
  versions including v1.10 and v1.11 series.  More to come!

1.4.1 (2018-10-17)
------------------

- Support CORS (cross-origin resource sharing) for browser-based API clients (#99).

- Fix the agent revival detection routine to update agent's address and region
  for movable demo devices (#100).

  - Downloading and uploading large files from virtual folders via streaming (#70)
  - Inviting other users and accepting such invitations with three-level permissions
    (read-only, read-write, read-write-delete) for collaboration via virtual folders
    (#80)
  - Now it requires explicit "recursive" option to remove directories (#89)
  - New "mkdir" API to create empty directories (#89)

- Support listing files in the session's main container. (#63)

- All API endpoints are now available *without* version prefixes, as we migrate
  to the vanilla aiohttp v3.4 release. (#78)

- Change `user_id` column type of `keypairs` model from integer to string.
  Now it can be used to store the user emails, UUIDs, or whatever identifiers
  depending on the operator's environment.

  Clients must be upgrade to 1.3.7 or higher to use string `user_id` properly.
  (The client will auto-detect the type by trying type casting.)

1.3.12 (2018-10-17)
-------------------

- Add CORS support (Hotfix #99 backported from v1.4 and master)

1.3.11 (2018-06-07)
-------------------

- Fix an internal "infinity integer" representation to have correct 64-bit maximum
  unsgined value.

1.3.10 (2018-05-01)
-------------------

- Fix a regression bug when restarting kernels.

1.3.9 (2018-04-12)
------------------

- Limit the default number of worker processes to avoid unnecessarily many workers in
  many-core systems and database connection exhaustion errors (lablup/backend.ai#17)

- Upgrade aiotools to v0.6.0 release.

- Ensure aiohttp's shutdown handlers to have access to databases during their
  execution, by moving connection pool cleanups to the aiohttp's cleanup handler.

1.3.8 (2018-04-06)
------------------

- Fix bugs in resolving image tags and aliases (#71)

1.3.7 (2018-04-04)
------------------

- Improve database initialization during setup by auto-detecting existing or fresh
  new databases in the CLI's "schema oneshot" command. (#69)

1.3.6 (2018-04-04)
------------------

- Further SQL transaction fixes

- Change the access key string of the non-admin example keypair

1.3.5 (2018-03-23)
------------------

- Further improve synchronization when destroying and restarting kernels.

- Change the agent load balancer to favor CPUs first to spread kernels evenly.
  (In the future versions, this will be made configurable and customizable.)

1.3.4 (2018-03-23)
------------------

- Improve synchronization when executing codes right after creating kernels by
  ensuring all DB operations (incl. read-only ops) to be inside (nested)
  transactions.

1.3.3 (2018-03-20)
------------------

- Improve vfolder APIs to handle sub-directories correctly when uploading and use
  the configured mount directory ("volumes/_mount" key in our etcd namespace).

1.3.2 (2018-03-15)
------------------

- Technical release to fix backend.ai-common depedency version.

1.3.1 (2018-03-14)
------------------

- Allow separate upgrade of the manager from v1.2 to v1.3 by extrapolating a new
  "kernel_host" field in the return value of the internal krenel creation RPC call.

1.3.0 (2018-03-08)
------------------

- Now the Backend.AI gateway uses a modular architecture where you can add 3rd-party
  extensions as aiohttp.web.Application and middlewares via ``BACKEND_EXTENSIONS``
  environment variable. (#65)

- Adopt aiojobs as the main coroutine task scheduler. (#65)
  Using this, improve handler/task cancellation as well.

- Public non-authorized APIs become accessible without "Date" HTTP header set. (#65)

- Upgrade aiohttp to v3.0 release. (#64)

- Improve dockerization support. (#62)

- Fix "X-Method-Override" support that was interfering with RFC-7807-style error
  reporting.  Also return correct HTTP status code when failed route resolution.

1.2.2 (2018-02-14)
------------------

- Add metadata/aliases for TensorFlow v1.5 kernel images to the default sample configs.

- Polish CI and test suites.

- Add etcd put/get/del manager CLI commands to get rid of the necessity of an extra
  etcdcli binary during installation. (lablup/backend.ai#15)

1.2.1 (2018-01-30)
------------------

- Minor update to fix dependency versions.

1.2.0 (2018-01-30)
------------------

**NOTICE**

- From this release, the manager and agent versions will go together, which indicates
  the compatibility of them, even when either one has relatively little improvements.

**CHANGES**

- The gateway server now consider per-agent image availability when scheduling a new
  kernel. (#29)

- The execute API now returns exitCode value of underlying subprocesses in the batch
  mode. (#60)

- The gateway server is now fully horizontally-scalable.
  There is no states shared via multiprocessing shared memory and all such states are
  now managed by a separate Redis instance.

- Improve logging: it now provides multiprocess-safe file-based rotating logs. (#10)

- Fix the Admin API error when filtering agents by their status due to a missing
  method parameter in ``Agent.batch_load()``.

1.1.0 (2018-01-06)
------------------

**NOTICE**

- Requires alembic database migration for upgrading.

**API CHANGES**

- The semantic for client session token changes. (#56, #58)
  Clients may reuse the same session token across different sessions if only a single
  session is running at a time.
  The manager now returns an explicit error if the client request is going to violate
  this constraint.

- In the API responses, Rate-Limit-Reset is gone away and now we have
  Rate-Limit-Window value instead. (#55)

  Since we use a rolling counter, there is no explicit reset point but you are now
  guaranteed to send at most N requests for the last 15 minutes (where N is the
  per-user rate limit) at ANY moment.

- When continuing or sending user-inputs via the execute API, you
  must set the mode field to "continue" or "input" respectively.

- You no longer have to specify a random run ID on the first request of a run during
  session; if the field is set to null, the server will assign a new run ID
  automatically.  Note that you STILL have to specify the run ID on subsequent
  requests for the run. (#59)

  All API responses now include its corresponding run ID regardless of whether it is
  given by the client or assigned by the server, which eases client-side
  demultiplexing of concurrent executions.

**OTHER IMPROVEMENTS**

- Fix atomicity of rate-limiting calculation in multi-core setups. (#55)

- Remove simplejson from dependencies in favor of the standard library.
  The stdlib has been updated to support all required features and use
  an internal C-based module for performance.

1.0.4 (2017-12-19)
------------------

- Minor update for execute API: allow explicit continue/input mode values.

- Mitigate connection failures after a DB failover event. (#35)

1.0.3 (2017-11-29)
------------------

- Add virtual folder!

- Update aioredis to v1.0.0 release.

- Remove "mode" argument when calling agent RPC "get completions" calls.

1.0.2 (2017-11-14)
------------------

- Fix synchronization issues when restarting kernels

- Fix missing database column errors when restarting streaming sessions

- Fix a missing null check when registering new agents or updating existing ones

1.0.1 (2017-11-08)
------------------

- Now we use a new kernel image naming and tagging scheme.
  Check out the comments in the sample image alias configuration
  at the repository root (image-aliases.sample.yml)

- Now the manager fully controls the resource allocation in agents
  when creating a new kernel session.

- Updated aiohttp to v2.3.2

- Various bug fixes and improvements

1.0.0 (2017-10-17)
------------------

- This release is replaced with v1.0.1 due to many bugs.

0.9.11 (2017-09-08)
-------------------

**NOTICE**

- The package name will be changed to "backend.ai-manager" and the import
  paths will become ``ai.backend.manager.something``.

**CHANGES**

- Let it accept "BackendAI" API requests as well for future compatibility.
  (#39)

0.9.10 (2017-07-18)
-------------------

**FIX**

- Fix the wrong version range of an optional depedency package "datadog"

0.9.9 (2017-07-18)
------------------

**IMPROVEMENTS**

- Improve packaging so that setup.py has the source list of dependencies
  whereas requirements.txt has additional/local versions from exotic
  sources.

- Support exception/event logging with Sentry.

0.9.8 (2017-07-07)
------------------

**FIX**

- Revert authorization in terminal pty streaming due to regression.

0.9.7 (2017-06-29)
------------------

**NEW**

- Add support for the batch-mode API with compiled languages such as
  C/C++/Java/Rust.

- Add support for the file upload API for use with the batch-mode API.
  (up to 20 files per request and 1 MiB per each file)

**IMPROVEMENTS**

- Upgrade aiohttp to v2.2.0.

0.9.6 (2017-05-09)
------------------

- Make the list of GPU instances configurable.
  (Later, this will be automatically detected without explicit configurations)

0.9.5 (2017-04-07)
------------------

- Add support for PyTorch kernels.

- Fix continuous API failures when faulty agents wrongly reports their status.

- Upgrade aiohttp to v2.

0.9.4 (2017-03-19)
------------------

- Improve packaging: auto-converted README.md as long description and unified
  requirements.txt and setup.py dependencies.

0.9.3 (2017-03-14)
------------------

- Fix internal API mismatch bug in web termainl.

0.9.2 (2017-03-14)
------------------

- Fix sorna-common requirement version.

0.9.1 (2017-03-14)
------------------

**IMPROVEMENTS**

- Handle v1/v2 API requests separately.
  Now it preserves old "aggregated" stdout/stderr/media outputs for v1
  but uses the new streaming outputs for v2.
  (v1 API users can use streaming as well, but they will loose the
  ordering information of individual lines of the console output.)

0.9.0 (2017-02-27)
------------------

**FIXES**

- Fix task pending error during shutdown due to missing await for redis
  monitoring task after cancelled.

- Fix wrong active instance count in Datadog stats due to missing checks for
  shadow in ``InstanceRegistry.enumerate_instances()``.

0.8.6 (2017-01-19)
------------------

**FIXES**

- Prevent potential CPU-hogging infinite loop during Datadog stats updates.

**IMPROVEMENTS**

- Add statistics reporting via Datadog. (optional feature)

- Improve exception handling and reporting, particularly for agent-sid errors.


0.8.5 (2017-01-14)
------------------

**FIXES**

- It now copes with API requests without bodies at all: use an empty string to
  generate signatures.

- Enabled authorization checks to stream-mode APIs, which has been disabled
  for debugging and tests.
  (Though the probability of exposing kernels to other users was very low
  due to randomly generated kernel IDs.)

0.8.4 (2017-01-11)
------------------

**FIXES**

- Stabilized sporadic restarts/disconnects of agent instances, and keep the
  concurrency usage consistent.

- Increased the minimum size of aioredis connection pools to avoid rare
  deadlocks due to pool exhaustion.

0.8.3 (2017-01-10)
------------------

**FIXES**

- Make sure all errorneous responses to contain RFC 7807-style JSON-formatted
  error messages using aiohttp middleware.

0.8.1 (2017-01-10)
------------------

**FIXES**

- Assume date headers in HTTP request headers without timezone offsets
  as UTC instead of showing internal server error.

0.8.0 (2017-01-10)
------------------

**NEW**

- Deprecated legacy ZMQ interface.  The code is still there, but should
  not be used.

- Refined keypair/usage database schema.

- Implemented the streaming-mode API: web terminal!

- Restarting the kernel in the middle of web termainl session are transparently
  handled -- user's browser-side websocket connections are preserved.

- The codebase now requires Python 3.6.0 or higher.

- Internally it adopted a simple event bus to handle asynchronous docker events
  such as abnormal termination of kernels.  Now most interactions with docker
  are truly asynchronous.

0.7.4 (2016-11-29)
------------------

**FIXES**

- Legacy ZMQ interface: Revived a missing language parameter in legacy
  client-side session token generation.
  This has broken CodeOnWeb's PRACTICE page.

- Gateway: Increased timeouts when interacting with agents.
  In particular, code execution timeouts must be longer than kernel execution
  timeouts.

- Gateway: Added a missing transaction context during authorization.
  This has caused "another operation in progress" errors with concurrent API
  requests within a very short period of time (under a few tens of msec).

0.7.3 (2016-11-28)
------------------

**CHANGES**

- When launching a new kernel and accessing to an existing kernel, it scans
  only "currently alive" instances by checking shadow keys that automatically
  expires.  This makes the Sorna service sustainable with abrupt agent failures.

0.7.2 (2016-11-27)
-----------------

**CHANGES**

- When launching a new kernel, it now chooses the least loaded agent instead of
  the first-found agent with free kernel slots.

0.7.1 (2016-11-25)
------------------

Hot-fix to add missing dependencies in requirements.txt and setup.py

0.7.0 (2016-11-25)
------------------

To avoid confusion with different version numbers in other Sorna sub-projects,
we skip the version 0.6.0 in all sub-projects.

**NEW**

- Implemented most of the REST API except streaming terminals and events.

- Added database schema for user/keypair information management.
  It can be initialized using ``python -m sorna.gateway.models`` command.

**FIXES**

- Fixed duplicate kernel count decrementing when destroying kernels in legacy manager.

0.5.1 (2016-11-15)
------------------

**FIXES**

- Added a missing check for stale kernel sessions due to restarts of Sorna agents.
  This bug has impacted public tutorial/workshops and demonstrations because the
  manager does not recreate kernels at the right timing.

0.5.0 (2016-11-01)
------------------

**NEW**

- First public release.
